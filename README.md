VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK
Vpn basically gives you privacy and protects your identity online. Since people work remotely and needs to connect online, businesses is required to create a secure line otherwise they are at risk of hacking and loss of data, these days VPN is used by everyone specially it ensures your location stays private, data is encrypted and also search the web anonymously.
How does the VPN work? When visiting a site, you type in a domain name and the server translates them. Every device browsing the internet has an Ip address, when sending message to the server it also sends your data while hackers can intercept your information. For example, if you are in a public place and connected to their Wi-Fi, browse the internet and you log onto your bank, someone with a computer can easily log into the network and have access to your personal information but using a VPN they cannot access it.
How VPN protects your identity: when you send information online a VPN creates a ton of encrypted information, this way if someone gets ahold of your data, they would not be able to read it, and a hacker to get the data. (They can but it’s much harder to do). So, when you send your data to a server it goes through the VPN first and it sends the data out to the website. The extra step helps in a lot of ways like changing your location.
